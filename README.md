About the Business
Global Mart is a globally connected retail company that offers a wide selection of food products, catering to everyday household needs. From fresh produce to pantry staples, the company operates with a mission to deliver high-quality goods efficiently through both physical stores and digital platforms. With a consumer-focused and data-informed mindset, Global Mart uses analytics not only to understand what sells - but to predict what matters most to their customers.
Pre-Analysis: The Strategic Questions
Before I began building this dashboard, I started by assessing the structure of a raw dataset filled with transaction-level information: product categories, monthly orders, supplier turnover rates, product status (active, discontinued, backordered), and expiration metrics.
From the outset, I aimed to explore:
Which product categories dominate in sales?
What is the volume performance of specific items?
How do supplier turnover and product expirations affect business operations?
When do order volumes and expirations spike?
These questions guided how I prepared, cleaned, and reshaped the data before visualizing it.
In-Analysis: From Data Points to Insight
Here's how I structured the dashboard and why:
Dominant Categories (Bar Chart) I showcased the top five product categories by total sales value. Fruits & Vegetables clearly lead the pack at $19,361, followed by Dairy and Grains & Pulses. This insight helps stakeholders prioritize sourcing and promotional efforts.
Product-Level Sales Volume (Bar Chart) By listing the most sold items - like Bread Flour, Pomegranate, and Cauliflower - I wanted to paint a clear picture of consumer preferences at the SKU level. These insights support procurement and demand forecasting.
Monthly Order Trends (Line Chart) Orders peak in February and June, with noticeable dips in September. These seasonal fluctuations help drive promotional calendar planning and inventory strategy.
Product Status Breakdown (Pie Chart) Products are categorized as Active, Backordered, or Discontinued, with each status hovering around $19,000 in volume. This visualization provides an at-a-glance view of portfolio health and inventory dynamics.
Top Supplier Turnover (Bar Chart) Suppliers like Katz and Quatz stood out with the highest turnover rates. High turnover could indicate fast-moving inventory or strong distribution reliability - important signals when evaluating supply chain partners.
Monthly Product Expirations (Line Chart) This shows a concerning rise in product expirations during February and May. This metric is vital for waste reduction strategies and expiration-sensitive stock planning.
Final Observations
This dashboard sheds light on a few key dynamics:
Product hierarchy is clear: Some categories and SKUs consistently lead in demand.
Order patterns reveal timing: February and June are busy months, suggesting predictable cycles.
Backorder and discontinued products need investigation: These can lead to customer dissatisfaction if not well-managed.
Expiration tracking is essential: High expiration counts may signal overstocking or poor rotation, directly impacting profitability.
Recommendations
Double Down on Best-Sellers: Allocate more shelf space and promotional investment to categories like Fruits & Vegetables.
Optimize Supplier Network: Reward high-turnover suppliers like Katz, but also evaluate if lower-performing ones need renegotiation or support.
Proactively Manage Inventory Lifecycle: Use historical expiration data to tweak order quantities and storage timelines.
Monitor and Minimize Backorders: Consider forecasting adjustments or supplier diversification to avoid disruptions.
Why These Visuals? My Chart Choices Explained
Every chart in this dashboard was chosen with intention:
Bar charts were used where I needed to compare categories, products, or suppliers side-by-side with clarity and precision.
Line graphs told the story of when things happened ,perfect for illustrating time trends in orders and expirations.
Pie charts offered a proportional breakdown, making it easy to digest status distributions within the product catalog.
Each one serves to simplify complex metrics into intuitive visuals that drive understanding and quick decision-making.
Defining Retail Success in a Data-Rich World
For companies like Global Mart, success isn't just about sales - it's about agility, supply resilience, and knowing how to reduce waste. This dashboard helps decision-makers see beyond surface-level metrics and zero in on what drives growth, loyalty, and operational excellence.
